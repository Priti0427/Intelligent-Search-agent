PROJECT TYPE: Search Engine Building


PROJECT FOCUS:

This project develops an intelligent multi-source search engine that addresses the challenge of answering complex, multi-faceted queries requiring information from diverse sources.

Problem:
- Traditional search engines return a list of links, leaving users to manually synthesize information across multiple documents
- Complex queries often require combining knowledge from different source types (web, academic, domain-specific)

Solution:
- Automatically decompose complex queries into sub-queries
- Retrieve relevant information from multiple sources (web, academic papers, domain-specific documents)
- Synthesize comprehensive answers with proper citations
- Use AI-augmented search to handle nuanced information needs in research and professional contexts


DATA OR SOURCES:

The search engine integrates three data sources:

1. Web Search (Tavily API)
   - Real-time web search for current information and general knowledge

2. Academic Papers (arXiv API)
   - Computer science, AI, and information retrieval research papers

3. Custom Document Corpus (ChromaDB)
   - Vector database for domain-specific PDFs, research papers, or technical documentation
   - Configurable chunking pipeline supporting:
     - Fixed-size chunking
     - Sentence-based chunking
     - Paragraph-based chunking
     - Semantic chunking


USERS AND INFORMATION NEEDS:

Primary Users:
- Researchers
- Students
- Professionals needing comprehensive answers to complex questions

Example Information Needs:

1. Graduate Student Query:
   - "Compare BM25 and dense retrieval methods for question answering"
   - Requires synthesis across multiple academic sources

2. Developer Query:
   - "What are the best practices for implementing RAG systems?"
   - Needs both current web resources and research papers

3. Researcher Query:
   - "How does BERT improve search ranking compared to TF-IDF, and what are the computational tradeoffs?"
   - Requires multi-hop reasoning across sources


PLANNED APPROACH:

System Architecture:
- Built using LangGraph for orchestrating a multi-step agentic workflow

Pipeline Components:
1. Query analysis and classification
2. Query decomposition into sub-queries
3. Intelligent routing to appropriate data sources
4. Parallel retrieval using:
   - Sparse methods (BM25)
   - Dense methods (embedding-based)
5. Answer synthesis with citation generation
6. Self-reflection loop for quality assurance

Evaluation Metrics:
- Retrieval effectiveness: Precision@k, Recall@k, MRR, MAP
- Answer quality: Faithfulness, Relevance, Completeness
- Comparative analysis of different retrieval and synthesis configurations
